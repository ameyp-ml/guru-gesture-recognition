`tensorflow_pretrain_classify.py` is the latest version with the cleanest code, the iPython notebooks are the oldest and probably the messiest. The python files whose names start with `train_` have code that deals with manipulating and preprocessing the dataset. Python files with names starting with `tensorflow_` are the main network training files. `layers.py` is a python module that has functions that wrap around tensorflow functions for creating network layers in a more convenient and less verbose manner. Earlier code uses lasagne while later code uses tensorflow.
